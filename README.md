# Reddit Clone

Greetings. 

My name is **Andrew Kombe**, the owner of this project.

This is a personal project that seeks to recreate [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) a popular social media site.

This repository has the backend and frontend microservices for the app.

The app was created in **Kali Linux**.

## Backend

The backend utilises the following technology:
    
  - Java (JDK 11)  
  - Spring (A Java web framework)
  - Maven (A Dependency Management Tool for Java) 
  - JWT (JSON Web Token)
  - MySQL (A relational database for the storage of data)

I used JWTs to secure the backend by using signed tokens with each request to use the API. 
The tokens enable the backend to only accept requests from trusted sources, i.e the app's frontend.

## Frontend
The frontend is found in the directory labeled Frontend **(src/Frontend)**. Check it out for details regarding the technology used there.
